# Monolyth — Cursor Rules (public-safe)

- Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, React 19, ESLint 9, Prettier 3.
- Do not add dependencies or change eslint/prettier config without explicit instruction.
- Lint scope is limited to: app, components, lib, data.
- Types: avoid `any`. Shared types live in lib/types.ts.
- Pages are server-first; use "use client" only when necessary.
- Share page renders HTML with MD fallback; keep current structure.
- All changes must pass:
  - npm run build
  - npm run lint
- Commit style: feat(scope): ..., fix(scope): ..., chore(...): ...
- Respect /docs/ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md for “done”.
