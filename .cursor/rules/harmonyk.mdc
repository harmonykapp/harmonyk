# Overview

Insert overview text here. The agent will only see this should they choose to apply the rule.

Operating rules:
- Unified diff only. Apply patches exactly. No file moves/renames unless explicitly requested.
- Strict TS: no any. Use unknown + narrowing if needed.
- Minimal diffs. No speculative refactors. Don’t change configs or add deps.
- Next.js SSR safety: no window/localStorage branching in render; useEffect for browser-only work.
- After diff: run npm run lint, npm run build, npm run dev and smoke-test listed routes.
- If anything fails, respond with exact fix diff.

Request format:
1) Goal:
2) Non-goals:
3) Acceptance criteria:
4) Smoke-test routes:
5) Implement as ONE unified diff.
6) End with: files changed + what changed.
