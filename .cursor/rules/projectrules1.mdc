# Monolyth — Cursor Rules (Internal)

- Treat `docs/NORTH_STAR.md` as the SSOT. Obey GA scope & non-goals.
- Do not introduce pricing or any blockchain/Web3/tokenomics.
- Before changing code, propose a short plan with impacted files.
- Keep diffs minimal and type-safe. Prefer Server Actions where possible.
- After each change I (human) will run: `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.
- If mock data is needed, put tiny fixtures in `/data`.
- Never commit secrets. Client code must not reference server keys.
