# Thread Diff — Harmonyk (Post-GA UI + Maestro Direction Update)
Source: 2025-12-20 "@THREAD_DIFF_PROMPT — Harmonyk (Post-GA UI + Maestro Direction Update)"

Applied changes:
- Added 2026 AI UX Doctrine (Predictive → Choices → Execute + Remind) to **NORTH_STAR.md**
- Added **User Progress Narrator**, **Actionable Widgets Standard**, **Reminder Layer**, **Viral Loops** to **PRODUCT_SPEC.md**
- Added **AI_ARCHITECTURE.md** with Action-centric RAG + Action Context Pack
- Added **PGW_PLAN.md** alignment (PGW1–PGW26 narrative)

Guardrails:
- Prompts stay available but are never required
- Maestro operates via UI actions, previews with "Why?", and reminders

Follow-ups:
- Wire `UserProgressState` enum + `computeUserProgress(userId)` (PGW2)
- Introduce widget sidecar pattern in UI kit (PGW1/2)
- Add reminder modes + guardrails (PGW3–PGW6)
