# Legacy / Archived Docs

This folder contains **historical snapshots** kept for reference only.

## Important
- **Do not run** any SQL in here against your database.
- The source of truth is: `supabase/migrations/*`

If you see references to old tables like `public.documents`, `public.versions`, or `public.shares`, those belong to early snapshots and should not be used by Harmonyk code.
